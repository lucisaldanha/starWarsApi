### `Star Wars Basic API`
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Intro

This basic website was created as a practice for the course The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery(lesson 226). 

The student was asked to create a Web App using the Star Wars API website, practicing fetch, promises and other knowledge gathered during the course so far.

## Student objective

Create a webpage that when selecting a button, the website displays the information selected in the button.

## Next steps

1 - Modify CSS styling:

 a) creating a dark background
 
 b) font color as yellow and font family same as Star Wars 

2 - Modify the code so we can display all the data available on the API.
